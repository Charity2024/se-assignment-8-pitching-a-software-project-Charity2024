A well-structured technical feasibility section builds confidence in the project's execution.

### Business Model
The business model outlines how the software will generate revenue. Essential components include:

* **Revenue streams:** Describe how the software will make money (e.g., subscriptions, advertising, licensing).
* **Customer segments:** Define the different customer groups.
* **Value proposition:** Clearly state the value delivered to customers.
* **Cost structure:** Outline the expenses involved in developing and operating the software.

A solid business model demonstrates the project's financial viability.

### Implementation Plan
